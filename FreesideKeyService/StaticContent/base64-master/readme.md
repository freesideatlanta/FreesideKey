===
A small, fast, and simple tool to encode and decode base64.

This is live at [https://pr.gg/base64/](https://pr.gg/base64/ "Live Base64 Converter")

Basic features tested to work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, IE11, and the Android Stock Browser (4.3+).

## Features
  * Convert to <i>and from</i> base64.
  * UTF-8.
  * Image drag and drop.
  * Add-to-homescreen.
  * Offline.

All of this could be yours for less than 8KB (total gzip'd transfer size including favicons).

## Modifying
Just open [index.html](index.html). Everything except https-only features (offline) works from the local filesystem.

An optional step is to run `gulp` to compress images and scripts. Instructions can be found in [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js).
